# Project: Data Lake on AWS

## Introduction
This project aims to construct a Data Lake on AWS.
The main function extracts the transactional raw data located on Amazon S3 as json files, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back to S3
as a set of dimensional and fact tables as parquet files.

## Project Datasets

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.
The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```json
{
  "num_songs": 1, 
  "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", 
  "artist_latitude": null, 
  "artist_longitude": null, 
  "artist_location": "", 
  "artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
  "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
  "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", 
  "duration": 152.92036, 
  "year": 0
}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above.
These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, looks like.

## Database Schema
### Schema for Song Play Analysis
This project uses star schema with one fact table and four dimension tables to optimize ad-hoc queries on song play analysis.

#### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page ```NextSong```
    - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*
#### Dimension Tables
2. users - users in the app
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
3. songs - songs in music database
    - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
4. artists - artists in music database
    - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
5. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## Project Structure
The workflow which reads raw data from S3, proccess to create the dimensional model and loads target tables back to S3 bucket into analytical structure on AWS is detailed below:

**1. ETL:**
The ETL proccess aims to populate staging tables with data from S3 and then process that data into analytics tables modeled following star-schema patterns.


## How to run
1. ```Modify dl.cfg```
    - The user must insert information about AWS Project ID, AWS SECRET, AWS PERSONAL TOKEN
2. ```etl.py```
    - Load data from S3 into staging tables on Amazon Redshift and process that data into analytics tables
