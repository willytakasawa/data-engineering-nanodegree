# Project: Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data,
which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project.
Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

## Project Datasets

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.
The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```json
{
  "num_songs": 1, 
  "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", 
  "artist_latitude": null, 
  "artist_longitude": null, 
  "artist_location": "", 
  "artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
  "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
  "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", 
  "duration": 152.92036, 
  "year": 0
}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above.
These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, looks like.

## Database Schema
### Schema for Song Play Analysis
This project uses star schema with one fact table and four dimension tables to optimize ad-hoc queries on song play analysis.

#### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page ```NextSong```
    - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*
#### Dimension Tables
2. users - users in the app
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
3. songs - songs in music database
    - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
4. artists - artists in music database
    - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
5. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## How to run
1. ```docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build```
    - builds a container with PostgreSQL
2. ```create_tables.py```
    - create and reload database and tables
3. ```etl.py```
    - reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into specific tables
4. ```test.ipynb```
    - displays the first few rows of each table to let sanity tests on the database
